      <p class="leadMain">Learning DSA is quite important as Data Structures are the building block of software 
        development and Algorithms provide efficiency while solving a problem. Hence, learning DSA will make 
        you a better problem-solver and help you crack coding rounds in tech companies. To ease your learning, 
        we have covered all the topics. We encourage you to go through all the topics and take assessments regularly </p>
